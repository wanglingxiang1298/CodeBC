Implement an abstract contract called Nonces, which provides some functionality for managing account nonces.
Description of the error types to be implemented
InvalidAccountNonce: This error type indicates that the account nonce is invalid.
Description of mappings to be implemented
mapping: This mapping is used to store the nonce values for each account.
Required Functions
nonces: This function is used to get the nonce value for the specified account.
_useNonce: This function is used to use the account's nonce value and return the new nonce value.
_useCheckedNonce: This function is used to use the account's nonce value and check if the given nonce matches the current nonce. If it does not match, an InvalidAccountNonce error is triggered.
