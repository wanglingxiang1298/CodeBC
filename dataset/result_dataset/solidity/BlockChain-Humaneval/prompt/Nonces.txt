Generate smart contract code that meets the following requirements:
 @dev Provides tracking nonces for addresses. Nonces will only increment.
 @dev The nonce used for an `account` is not the expected current nonce.
 @dev Returns the next unused nonce for an address.
 @dev Consumes a nonce. Returns the current value and increments nonce.
 @dev Same as {_useNonce} but checking that `nonce` is the next valid for `owner`.
Please give the contract code
