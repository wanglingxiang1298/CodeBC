Generate smart contract code that meets the following requirements:
Programming with solidity ^ version number 0.8.20
Implement the abstract contract called Initializable, which provides some functions and modifiers for initialization.
Description of the structures to be implemented
InitializableStorage: this structure contains two member variables:
_initialized: a variable of type uint64 that records whether the contract has been initialized.
_initializing: A boolean variable that identifies whether or not the initialization process is currently underway.
Description of constants to be implemented
INITIALIZABLE_STORAGE: This constant is a value of type bytes32 used to store the storage location of the InitializableStorage structure.
Description of the type of error to be implemented
InvalidInitialization: This error type indicates an invalid initialization process.
NotInitializing: This error type indicates that the initialization process is not currently in progress.
Description of events to be implemented
Initialized: This event is triggered when the initialization is completed and records the version number of the initialization.
Modifiers to be implemented
initializer: This modifier identifies a function as an initializer. It checks the status of the initialization and fires the Initialized event when the initialization is complete.
reinitializer: This modifier identifies a function as a reinitialized function. It checks the status of the initialization and triggers the Initialized event when the reinitialization is complete.
onlyInitializing: This modifier identifies a function that can only be called during initialization.
Description of the function to be implemented
_checkInitializing: This function is used to check if the function is currently initializing.
_disableInitializers: This function disables initialization. It will check if it is currently in the process of initialization and set the initialization state to the maximum value.
_getInitializedVersion: This function is used to get the current initialized version number.
_isInitializing: This function checks if the current initialization is in progress.
_getInitializableStorage(): This function is used to get the storage location of the InitializableStorage structure.
