Programming with solidity ^ version number 0.8.20
Implement three interface contracts named IERC20Errors, IERC721Errors and IERC1155Errors
Description of the IERC20Errors interface
This interface defines some of the error types associated with ERC20 tokens.
Error type descriptions
ERC20InsufficientBalance: This error type indicates that the sender's balance is insufficient to perform the transfer operation.
ERC20InvalidSender: This error type indicates that the sender is invalid.
ERC20InvalidReceiver: This error type indicates that the receiver is invalid.
ERC20InsufficientAllowance: This error type indicates that the authorization amount is insufficient to perform the transfer.
ERC20InvalidApprover: This error type indicates that the authorizer is invalid.
ERC20InvalidSpender: This error type indicates that the recipient of the transfer is invalid.
IERC721Errors Interface Description
This interface defines some of the error types associated with ERC721 tokens.
Error Type Description
ERC721InvalidOwner: This error type indicates that the owner is invalid.
ERC721NonexistentToken: This error type indicates a non-existent token.
ERC721IncorrectOwner: This error type indicates that the sender is not the correct owner of the token.
ERC721InvalidSender: This error type indicates that the sender is invalid.
ERC721InvalidReceiver: This error type indicates that the receiver is invalid.
ERC721InsufficientApproval: This error type indicates that the operator does not have sufficient authorization to perform the operation.
ERC721InvalidApprover: This error type indicates that the authorizer is invalid.
ERC721InvalidOperator: This error type indicates that the operator is invalid.
IERC1155Errors Interface Description
This interface defines some of the error types associated with ERC1155 tokens.
Error Type Description
ERC1155InsufficientBalance: This error type indicates that the sender's balance is insufficient to perform the transfer.
ERC1155InvalidSender: This error type indicates that the sender is invalid.
ERC1155InvalidReceiver: This error type indicates that the receiver is invalid.
ERC1155MissingApprovalForAll: This error type indicates that the operator does not have sufficient authorization for all tokens.
ERC1155InvalidApprover: This error type indicates that the authorizer is invalid.
ERC1155InvalidOperator: This error type indicates that the operator is invalid.
ERC1155InvalidArrayLength: This error type indicates an invalid array length.
