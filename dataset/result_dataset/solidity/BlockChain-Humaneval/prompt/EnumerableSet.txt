Generate smart contract code that meets the following requirements:
 @dev Library for managing https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)[sets] of primitive types. Sets have the following properties: - Elements are added, removed, and checked for existence in constant time (O(1)). - Elements are enumerated in O(n). No guarantees are made on the ordering. ```solidity contract Example {     // Add the library methods     using EnumerableSet for EnumerableSet.AddressSet;     // Declare a set state variable     EnumerableSet.AddressSet private mySet; } ``` As of v3.3.0, sets of type `bytes32` (`Bytes32Set`), `address` (`AddressSet`) and `uint256` (`UintSet`) are supported. [WARNING] ==== Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure unusable. See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info. In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an array of EnumerableSet. ====
 @dev Add a value to a set. O(1). Returns true if the value was added to the set, that is if it was not already present.
 @dev Removes a value from a set. O(1). Returns true if the value was removed from the set, that is if it was present.
 @dev Returns true if the value is in the set. O(1).
 @dev Returns the number of values on the set. O(1).
 @dev Returns the value stored at position `index` in the set. O(1). Note that there are no guarantees on the ordering of values inside the array, and it may change when more values are added or removed. Requirements: - `index` must be strictly less than {length}.
 @dev Return the entire set in an array WARNING: This operation will copy the entire storage to memory, which can be quite expensive. This is designed to mostly be used by view accessors that are queried without any gas fees. Developers should keep in mind that this function has an unbounded cost, and using it as part of a state-changing function may render the function uncallable if the set grows to a point where copying to memory consumes too much gas to fit in a block.
