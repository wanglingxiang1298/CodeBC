interfaceHash: This function calculates a hash value for the given interface name.
updateERC165Cache: This function updates the ERC165 cache at the specified address.
implementsERC165Interface: This function checks if the address implements the given ERC165 interface.
implementsERC165InterfaceNoCache: This function checks if the specified address implements the specified ERC165 interface without using the cache.
Description of events to be accomplished
